            <h1>Research about Javascript, ECMAScript, TypeScript</h1>

            <p> Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, but two languages <br> 
                are distinct and differ greatly in design. 
            </p>

            <p>Javascript is a programming language, along side 'HTML', 'CSS' it helped to create 97% of World Wide Web. <br>
                Most of the Website uses Javascript on client side in the Web browser to create Webpage behavior. All major <br>
                Web browser have dedicated Javascript engine to execute dedicated code on user side. JavaScript engines were <br> 
                originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. <br>
                The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js. Javascript is a higher language that conforms to <br>
                the ECMAScript standards.

            </p>
            <p>ECMAScript is a standard meant to ensure the interoperability of web pages across different web browsers. <br>
                The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. <br>
                In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
            </p>
            <p>TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of <br>
                JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. It is designed for the development of large applications. <br>
                Existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs. TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications <br>
                for both client-side and server-side execution
            </p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The first Web browser was developed in 1993 with graphical user interface. Javascript first version was released in 1995 <br>
                The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it is directly related to Java. Microsoft debuted  <br>
                Internet Explorer in 1995. JScript was first released in 1996, alongside initial support for CSS and extensions to HTML. <br>
                JScript was Microsoft version of Interpreater developed to run for Explorer. 
            </p>
            <p>In November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International, as the starting point for a standard specification <br>
                that all browser vendors could conform to. This led to the official release of the first ECMAScript language specification in June 1997.<br>
                The standards process continued for a few years, with the release of ECMAScript 2 in June 1998 and ECMAScript 3 in December 1999. <br>
                Work on ECMAScript 4 began in 2000. <br>
                Google debuted its Chrome browser in 2008, with the V8 JavaScript engine that was faster than its competition.<br>
                The key innovation was just-in-time compilation.
